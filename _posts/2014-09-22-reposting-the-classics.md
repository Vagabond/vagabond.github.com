Ever since my old woodshed hosted zotonic blog went down, people have been bugging me to repost my 'classic' articles on egitd and poolboy. My friend Reid Draper finally pushed me over the cliff tonight, so here you guys go:

* [Optimizing egitd - Introduction](/programming/2011/02/06/optimizing-egitd---introduction)
* [Optimizing egitd - Part 1](/programming/2011/02/06/optimizing-egitd---part-1)
* [Optimizing egitd - Part 2](/programming/2011/02/07/optimizing-egitd---part-2)
* [Optimizing egitd - Part 3](/programming/2011/02/07/optimizing-egitd---part-3)
* [Optimizing egitd - Part 4](/programming/2011/02/08/optimizing-egitd---part-4)
* [Optimizing egitd - Part 5](/programming/2011/02/11/optimizing-egitd---part-5)
* [Quickchecking poolboy for fun and profit](/programming/2012/01/21/quickchecking-poolboy-for-fun-and-profit/)

Kudos to the wayback machine to keeping a copy around for me.
