So, I finally decided to stand up a github backed blog, since my previous blog
hosting moved to my friend's woodshed, which had a rather indifferent approach
to clean power. Restarting zotonic every time the machine came back up was too
much work, and writing an init script felt like too much work, too.

After a few months of the blog being completely offline, I decided to dust
off the old github pages blog repo I tinkered with way back in 2009. I threw
away my old bumbling attempts and cloned the jekyll-bootstrap repo and got
hacking. The only reason it looks pretty is that this is the default theme;
I hate CSS even more than I hate writing init scripts.

Eventually I'll probably re-post my 'classic' posts from the old blog, but for
now I'm going to try to write some new stuff.
