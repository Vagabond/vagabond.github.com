So, last Thursday I gave a talk in San Francisco at RICON West. As I didn't get
to cover everything in the talk I decided to do a writeup with some more
detail (and less swearing, sorry about that).

First of all, I am not a security expert, these are just my opinions and
thoughts on a bunch of very complicated topics. You should supplement this with
your own research. I'll provide some useful links at the end.

Some of the things I didn't cover in the talk, but that arguably fall under the
umbrella of security:

* Securing intra-cluster communication - This is something we used to have,
  although it was cumbersome to configure. We plan to re-introduce this after
  2.0.
* Encrypting the data stored in Riak - Doing this at the database level doesn't
  make a lot of sense, to serve reads, the database would have to be able to
  decrypt the data to return it to the client. It really makes more sense to
  encrypt data, if you really feel the need to, at the client side.
* Capabilities VS ACLs - This is a bit of a contentious issue. We decided to go
  with ACLs because they're more familiar to people used to administrating
  databases and there's fewer issues around issuing/revoking them.
* Multi-tenancy - While data isolation does provide some of the foundations for
  building a multi-tenant database, it does not address the 'noisy neighbour'
  problem or the question of quotas.
* Cool distributed systems stuff - Basically I just leaned on riak_core for most
  of that, especially the new cluster metadata stuff Jordan West added for Riak
  2.0.

Since we're not talking about any of the above, what are we covering? The real
focus of the work is to secure client<->Riak communications. Now, as my friend
Ryan Zezeski at Basho likes to say, "security is a farce" and, to some extent,
he is correct. Security is really about raising the bar high enough that you're
not trivial to compromise. There are always weak links, and some of them you
just can't fix with technology, like social engineering. This work is just
aiming to raise the security bar for Riak from lying on the ground to be
comparable to its competition.

For a long time, the party line at Basho was "Riak doesn't need security", and
that any needed security could be added at the network level, either via network
architecture or firewalling off Riak from the internet. Another popular way to
deploy Riak was to build a Riak-backed API server and make all the clients go
through that API server and isolate Riak from raw client input.

There's nothing wrong with any of that, of course, but it doesn't provide the
same level of security as the above methods *plus* a database with the concept
of built in security. The above approaches don't necessarily address the issues
of man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, compromised clients or audit trails. To properly
secure your data, Riak really needs to know about users and what a particular
user can do. This way unintended data access can be prevented and reported on,
assuming you grant your users only the permissions they need.

Security, in my view at least, is really composed of 4 pieces: encryption,
authentication, authorization and auditing. You can't securely communicate with
a server without encryption, you need to authenticate with the database to
figure out what you're authorized to do, and finally, there should be an audit
trail for every action so if an intrusion does happen, you can see what the
intruder did.

Let's cover the 4 pieces in more detail, with a view to the implementation in
Riak. First up is encryption.

Encryption
----------

So, the 'industry standard' for encryption is, as you might expect, that old
chestnut SSL/TLS. A lot of people I've talked to proclaim they "don't
undertstand SSL" so I'm going to go over the basics.

SSL (Secure Socket Layer) originated at Netscape in the mid nineties. The
original SSL 1.0 was never released. 2.0. released in 1995, was quickly
discovered to be flawed. 1996 saw the release of SSL 3.0 which is still common
today, althouch considered weak by modern standards.

In 1999 TLS (Transport Layer Security)  1.0 was released, it was backwards
incompatible with SSL 3.0, which is presumably why they changed the name. TLS
1.1 came out in 2006, and the main highlight was protection against some of the
CBC (Chained Block Cipher) attacks against SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0. The
[BEAST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#BEAST_attack)
attack is a good example of this kind of attack. Finally, TLS 1.2 was released
in 2008 and mainly tweaks the ciphers used and adds some more flexibility to the
TLS handshake.

Unfortunately, most of the internet still runs on [SSL 3.0 and TLS
1.0](https://www.trustworthyinternet.org/ssl-pulse/). 99+% still support the
older protocols and less than 20% support TLS 1.1 or 1.2.

Related (or responsible for that) is that the popular TLS implementations have
lagged behind the standard for a long time. OpenSSL only gained support for TLS
1.1 and 1.2 in 1.0.0, released in 2013. GNUTLS really led the pack, implementing
TLS 1.2 before the standard was even finalized, and enabling it by default (I
think) sometime around 2.9.9 in 2009. NSS, the Mozilla implementation, also only
gained TLS 1.2 support in 2013, with version 3.15.1.

And this trickles down to programming languages, too: Ruby 2.0.0 in 2013 saw the
implementation of TLS 1.2 (if the system's OpenSSL supports it), Java 7
implemented TLS 1.2 in 2011 (which is creditable), Erlang gained support in 2013
as well with the release of R16B and Python 3.4, expected before the end of 2013
will have support as well (although there is a python-gnutls binding you can use
instead).

Web browsers also saw a similar progression. Chrome 30, Firefox 28 (not
generally released at the time of this writing). Internet Explorer
11, Opera 17 and Safari 7 all implement TLS 1.2 and have it enabled by default.
ALL of these (with the exception of Firefox 28 which looks like it will release
in early 2014) were released in 2013.

So, one bright note is that we're finally, as of November 2013, living in a
world of 2006 state-of-the-art encryption.

Now that we've covered the myriad of SSL/TLS flavors, let's talk about how the
TLS handshake works, at the high level:

* The client sends a Hello message indicating the highest TLS version it
  supports, a random number and the cipher suites it supports.
* The server responds with its own Hello message, telling the client what
  version of TLS will be used, another random number and the cipher suite the
  server has chosen.
* The server will also send, if using PKI, its public key.
* The client sends, again depending on the key exchange protocol, a pre-master
  secret it has generated, encrypted with the server's public key. It may also
  send its own private key, if the client is using certificates as well.
* The client and the server now use the shared information to generate some new
  encryption keys.
* The connection switches into encrypted mode, using the new keys.

For a more detailed explanation,
[Wikipedia has a good
writeup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security#Basic_TLS_handshake).

There's actually various ways key exchange can work: it can be completely
anonymous, it can use some kind of shared secret
([PSK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-shared_key),
[SRP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Remote_Password_protocol)) or it can
use a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). The latter is the most common, as it is
how HTTPS work. Anonymous exchanges are vulnerable to MITM attacks, so they
are illegal in TLS 1.2.

Pre-Shared Key (PSK) and Secure Remote Password (SRP) are both variations on the idea
that both the server and client share some secret information, like a
user/password combo. Using that shared secret they can bootstrap a secure
connection because they don't have to exchange the secure information over the
wire, just derivatives of it, which you'd need the original to be able to
verify/decrypt. The main downfall of these approaches is that if the secured
secret is compromised a client can masquerade as a server and vice versa. SRP
actually ensures that the server stores a 'verifier', which is a derivation of
the password, not the actual password, so it is harder. Unfortunately, the
flavor of SRP used in TLS-SRP uses [2 rounds of
SHA1](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5054#section-2.4) as the hashing mechanism,
which doesn't really stand up to modern brute forcing attacks using GPUs and the
like.

[Public key cryptography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography)
works on the idea that every server (and sometimes client) has an asymmetric
public/private key pair. Data encrypted by a public key, which is freely
distributed, can only be decrypted by using the private key, which is kept
secret. Conversely, data can be 'signed' using the
private key and that signature can be verified using the public key. The
properties of this enable the implementation of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
key exchange.

In PKI, the server has a public/private key pair, signed directly or indirectly
by some trusted third party, the Certificate Authority (CA). The chain of
'intermediate' CAs can be quite long, and 3-4 is not uncommon. Operating systems
and browsers often include a default bundle of 'trusted' root CAs, of which now
there are about 650. That is a lot of people to trust, given that some of the
'intermediates' can also sign CAs. In the past this has caused a lot of problems
when a CA is compromised, or just plain goes rogue and does things like sign
certificates for google or paypal and starts MITM attacking users using those
services. Some browsers, notably Chrome, support 'certificate pinning' where the
browser ships with a list of certificates for certain domains, if you see an
apparently valid certificate for that domain, but it doesn't match your
database, you know you're being attacked.

However, for connecting to Riak, there's no reason to trust all 650+ of these
CAs, the client should *know* what CA the server is using and should require the
server use only that CA. This isolates you from the 'trusted' CAs doing dodgy
things and also lets you easily run your own CA (which is what I'd recommend
anyway).

So, once you've actually connected to a TLS server, the server will send you
the client certificate along with any intermediate certificates and sometimes
even the root CA. Then you have to verify that the CA chain is complete from the
peer certificate back to a root CA *you* trust, not just whatever the server
provides as the root CA. You also have to verify that all the CA certificates in
the chain are *allowed* to sign certificates. Back in the days of early SSL,
some implementations only checked the chain was validly signed but not that all
certificates in the chain were allowed to sign certificates themselves. So, you
could buy a certificate for your own domain name and then use that certificate
as a CA certificate to sign your own certificate for paypal.com and MITM people
with it. The final check that needs to be done is to check all the certificates
are not expired and revoked. Here's an image of what a certificate chain looks
like:


![](/assets/images/TLSTrust.png)

As you can see, each CA maintains a Certificate Revocation List (CRL), which is
a cryptographically signed list of revoked certificates, and each
certificate for that CA contains a reference to a URI where its CRL can be
obtained. The CRL is (usually) signed by the CA so you can trust its validity
and it contains information on how long the particular instance of the CRL is
valid. The root CA obviously has no CRL for itself; [<i>Quis custodiet ipsos
custodes?</i>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quis_custodiet_ipsos_custodes?)

Now, compared to PSK or SRP, this PKI thing is a clearly lot more work. Why
bother with it? There's a few reasons: Clients can't masquerade as servers. or
vise versa if one is compromised, CRLs let you centrally revoke a certificate if
it is compromised and with PKI there's meaningful identity information attached.

Authentication
--------------

After that somewhat lengthy segue, we can move onto authentication and start
getting a little more in-depth with Riak's implementation.

Authentication in Riak 2.0 is heavily inspired by PostgreSQL. Postgres'
authentication model isn't exactly the easiest to use, but it does provide a lot
of flexibility. I've borrowed a lot of ideas while hopefully smoothing over some
of the smooth edges and legacy choices.

Riak borrows the ideas of 'roles' from Postgres, all users and groups are
roles and roles may be members of other roles. You can add roles like this:

```
riak-admin security add-user andrew
```

```
riak-admin security add-user greg password=1234
```

Now that you have a user, you have to tell Riak how they can authenticate. Riak
2.0 supports the following authentication methods:

* Trust - Don't require a password, trust the user. Most appropriate for
  development or for clients on a trusted network.
* Password - Check user's password against a
  [PBKDF2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) hashed password, stored in Riak.
* [PAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluggable_authentication_module) - PAM
  almost has a backend for everything, so this provides a lot of flexibility.
* Certificate authentication - Client sends a certificate signed by the same CA
  as the server's and the certificate's common name must match the username.

An authentication source tells Riak that for certain users, coming from a
particular
[CIDR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation)
network a particular authentication source is required. Examples of adding
authentication sources:

```
riak-admin security add-source all 127.0.0.1/32 trust
```

Trusts any user connecting from localhost.

```
riak-admin security add-source andrew,greg 10.0.0.0/24 password
```

Require a password for andrew and greg when they connect from the 10.0.0.0 class
C network.

```
riak-admin security add-source all 0.0.0.0/0 pam service=login
```

Everybody else must use PAM authentication, via the 'login' service.

Authentication sources are sorted by Riak, most specific first, but only the
first matching source is tested. So if 'andrew', connecting from 10.0.0.24
failed to authenticate via Riak's password database, Riak would not retry the
authentication against PAM.

If you want to make one role a member of another, you can use the roles user
attribute:

```
riak-admin security add-user dev
```

```
riak-admin security add-user ops
```

```
riak-admin security add-user andrew roles=dev,ops
```

Authorization
-------------

Riak continues the trend of borrowing ideas from Postgres when it comes to the
ACL management. Riak core applications [register the
permissions](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/blob/3ec711efda2a5de043cafe2455e3f062765936b2/src/riak_kv_app.erl#L201-L202)
they wish to expose as part of the riak_core:register() call. Those permissions
are prefixed by the name of the riak_core app, so if riak_kv registers the 'get'
permission, it becomes the riak_kv.get permission. This ensures that permissions
will not conflict across cooexisting riak_core applications on the same
node/cluster.

All API endpoints indicate what ACL(s) they require. You can see examples in the
[HTTP](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/blob/3ec711efda2a5de043cafe2455e3f062765936b2/src/riak_kv_wm_object.erl#L235-L251)
and
[PB](https://github.com/basho/riak_kv/blob/3ec711efda2a5de043cafe2455e3f062765936b2/src/riak_kv_pb_object.erl#L85-L86)
APIs.

To add/remove permissions from a user, there are grant/revoke commands:

```
riak-admin security grant riak_kv.get,riak_kv.put ON default mybucket TO andrew
```

```
riak-admin security revoke riak_kv.put ON default mybucket FROM andrew
```

Now, if you're wondering what the 'default' in the above examples is, it is a
[Bucket
Type](http://lists.basho.com/pipermail/riak-users_lists.basho.com/2013-November/013847.html),.
The 'default' bucket type is where any data in a Riak cluster lives that isn't
under a specific bucket type. So if you upgrade an existing Riak cluster, all
your data will live in buckets under the 'default' bucket type. I suggest you
read the above link and the links it links to for more information.

Assuming you've created your own bucket type, you can then grant/revoke on that
bucket type:

```
riak-admin security grant riak_kv.get ON mytype mybucket TO andrew
```

In this case, we only grant a permission on a bucket type AND bucket, the
request must match both to be granted by this ACL.

```
riak-admin security grant riak_kv.put ON mytype TO andrew
```

Now this grant is a little different. We're granting on the *whole* bucket type
at once, such that any bucket under that bucket type will satisfy the ACL. This
can be handy if your application needs to dynamically create buckets, but you
still want to have separate ACL rules for different parts of your data.

```
riak-admin security grant riak_kv.delete ON ANY to andrew
```

This is the big hammer, ignore bucket type and bucket and just let the user
delete anything. I wouldn't recommend this for most things, but it can be
helpful in certain cases, like retrofitting security onto a legacy Riak client
application, perhaps.

Riak's command line tool riak-admin also includes support for inspecting the
users, authentication sources and grants:

```
riak-admin security print-users
```

<pre><tt>
+----------+---------------+----------------------------------------+------------------------------+
| username |     roles     |                password                |           options            |
+----------+---------------+----------------------------------------+------------------------------+
|  admins  |               |                                        |              []              |

+----------+---------------+----------------------------------------+------------------------------+
</tt></pre>

```
riak-admin security print-sources
```

Note that there is a bug in the tech preview with this command, it'll crash if
any user is a member of any roles. Sorry.

| default  |    *     |              riak_kv.get               |
+----------+----------+----------------------------------------+
</tt></pre>

As you can see, because 'andrew' is a member of the 'admins' role he inherits
the permissions from that role, which means that the applied permissions contain
those permissions as well as any permissions he has himself.

Really, this is all pretty standard stuff, if you're familiar with Postgres or,
to a lesser extent, other ACL equipped databases. And really, that is about all
there is to say on how to use it.

If you want to see an example of security in action there are sample
[HTTP](https://gist.github.com/Vagabond/05b7dc8ae6d3ca4af6c2) and
[PB](https://gist.github.com/Vagabond/6222793a1d352f1ccdd2) sessions.

There does remain some more work to do before 2.0 lands. Not everything I want
to do for security will make it in, but expect future releases to improve upon
what 2.0 will deliver. alter-user/source and del-source will be need to be added
as well as some way to disable/deactivate users. There's also some of the
deeper, darker corners of the Riak API that don't have corresponding ACLs.
Finally, I would really like to tune the default TLS cipher list so we can
ensure clients are using the best ciphers for the speed/security tradeoff.

This post is only actually about the first half of my talk, but it is running so
long already I'm going to split the rest into a separate post that will mostly
deal with the hurdles I encountered implementing all of this.
